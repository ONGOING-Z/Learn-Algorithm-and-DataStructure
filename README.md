## README

DataStructure and Algorithms are important to us. 
So here I summarize some basic knowledge of them.

Besides, practice makes perfact. So after learning the theory of data structure
and algorithms, you'd better do some related problems. It will deepen your
impression, and you'll be more familiar with them.
