 *1395. Count Number of Teams
There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
A team is valid if:  (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

 

Example 1:

Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
Example 2:

Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.
Example 3:

Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

n == rating.length
1 <= n <= 200
1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5

/* my solution */
// brute force
class Solution {
public:
    int numTeams(vector<int>& rating) {
        int res = 0;
        // brute force
        int n = rating.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; j++)
            {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++)
                {
                    if (rating[i] < rating[j] && rating[j] < rating[k] || 
                       rating[i] > rating[j] && rating[j] > rating[k])
                        res++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
        
    }
};
